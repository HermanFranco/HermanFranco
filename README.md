- ðŸ‘‹  Hi! Iâ€™m Herman Franco, a web developer, working remotely creating a web app to parcels administration for an agricultural company.

I have more than 5 years of experience among different areas like digital design, digital marketing, front-end development, and my current role as full stack developer.

On this days I have been updating myself to work with MERN, within the last weeks I have been researching, studying, creating prototypes, and coding.

Outside of work you will find me watching or playing soccer, videogames, and sharing with my family.
